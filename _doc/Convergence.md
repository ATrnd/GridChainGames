# Grid Chain Games — Convergence

It's impressive to see how diverse the crypto space has become in recent years and the infinite possibilities it provides for developers and startups. There are so many directions, ideologies, and business models we can experiment with, and the list is continuously growing.

When my interest in game development began back in 2016, I couldn't even dream of these possibilities, but there was one significant fact, I knew for sure: that the foundation of every new (game) economy was value, and once we created that value, we could give it a symbol and name it; this is how we get a currency. 

Currency is what people mainly interact with in their everyday lives, but how do we create value? Let's pretend that we know all that for a moment. Another crucial (and less obvious) question is how we make that value 'visible' to people. For the mainstream, the 'value' created by the explosion of the Web3 space, DAOs, dapps, tokens, NFTs, and a huge list I'm not going to include here is too blurry to understand in 2024 truly.

Most people are too busy, sceptical, or uninterested in the 'big picture'. Most people are not concerned with economies but desire attraction, something they can connect or relate to, encouraging them to take the next step towards perhaps something (radically) new.

Grid Chain Games is the first public version of something I've been experimenting with for many years. "It's just text and images", simulation of on-chain randomization, and summarizing data essentially.

But there is much more to it than what we can observe or predict based on the code, the UI, or the general docs. I like to think of it as The WordPress of Web3 in a sense.

There are way too many cool Blockchain projects and builders to list here, but frankly, from a mainstream perspective, it's mostly just noise. (It's all amazing, but...) We need an overall methodology to introduce all that awesomeness to the masses. We need a well-defined structure everyone recognizes, understands and trusts. 

We must accept that learning all the rules of this new era will take time, energy, and effort. And I'm not considering early adopters here. I'm talking about John and Jane Does on the edge of Web2/Web3 space, waiting for awakening.

I firmly believe that we got to the point where we're now with the Web 2.0 domain because certain repeating patterns and behaviours in the system ultimately led humans to develop their business models, strategies, and technologies in one specific direction.

But let's stick with repeating patterns for now. Repeating patterns may only occur (in any context) if we have a pre-defined order of 'symbols'. Currently, what we have in the Web3 space (from my point of view) are floating symbols with similarities and formulas but with way less volume and structure than the ones that shaped the Web2 economy decades ago.

I spent half my life playing games and the other half tinkering with code that should be implemented in games. I built GCG to serve as a pattern—a pattern everyone can use and something that can be extended to support tokenization, NFT projects, or interaction with multiple cryptocurrencies.

It has the foundational model, which can be utilized just as we'd use a multipurpose programming language or web framework to serve us as we need it. For now, it's on the lowest level, modelling a prototype supporting a gamified way of interaction with ETH that can be extended with an infinite amount of themes and adopted by influencers & businesses, but that's just the beginning. With more level implementations & a 'low-level trust model' mechanism, it can be further extended with standardized & gamified tokenization methods and NFTs.

It's simple, but that's what people need: something they know, understand and can interact with from muscle memory. Something they can fall in love with, explore, and learn more about but at their own pace.

Using GCG concepts as a minimalist 'promotional framework' and extending it with more modules and features, like a CMS for creators, but keeping its gamification persona could be a special layer between Web3 projects and the public. It could be utilized to support the 'standardization procedure' of Web3 project idea presentations to the masses.

It's all about 'repeating patterns'; the stronger the pattern, the more trust and demand it gains. We have enough diversity; now, we need a model to standardize how we consistently present these new ideas and make all that an engaging experience.
