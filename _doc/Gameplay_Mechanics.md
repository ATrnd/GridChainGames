# Grid Chain Games â€” Gameplay Mechanics

## Core Concept

Grid Chain Games (GCG) is a browser-based web3 game that emphasizes minimalism and a low screen-time approach.
Players progress by completing daily steps, with a 24-hour cooldown between actions.
The game rewards users with Ethereum for completing tasks and accumulating experience points (XP).
There are no NFTs or significant investments required; players only need a crypto wallet and access to Layer 2 Ethereum.
Steps generate XP and credits while also unfolding stories accompanied by illustrations.
The game prioritizes security, implementing measures to prevent bot and direct attacks on the game engine.

## Gameplay Mechanics

Grid Chain Games introduces players to a dynamic web3 gaming experience.
Upon connecting their wallets, users create usernames and choose from AI-generated avatars.
Each game operates within a fixed lifespan, typically lasting around one month.
During this period, players undertake a series of objectives to progress towards the final stage and claim rewards.
Alpha game objectives include completing daily steps and accumulating experience points and credits.
Successful completion of all steps leads to group formation, with registration fees redistributed among participants.
In the game's culmination, players can withdraw earned assets based on their performance.
Following the game's conclusion, remaining assets are either distributed among players or sent to the Ethereum black hole, contributing to network health and value.
GCG releases new games monthly or quarterly, integrating updated features and security enhancements using the latest Solidity version.

## Player Progression

Player progression in Grid Chain Games relies on a global counter linked to each player's address, tracking completed game cycles.
Advancement is marked by improving "reputation," granting access to more advanced or specialized game editions as players accumulate reputation points.
