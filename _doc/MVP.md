# Grid Chain Games â€” MVP

## MVP Introduction

The Grid Chain Games Minimum Viable Product (MVP) operates within a browser environment, leveraging vanilla Javascript without web3 dependencies.
Drawing inspiration from Py-EVM, it serves as a tool for rapid ideation, outlining, and demonstration of game mechanics and account progression.
Utilizing the Document Object Model (DOM), the MVP injects, sorts, and summarizes data to simulate core gameplay states and security concepts.
Its primary focus lies in establishing the foundational pillars of the game engine, serving as a conceptual reference.
Once concepts are validated, they can seamlessly transition to Solidity for implementation.

## MVP Concept

Grid Chain Games MVP features Javascript simulations showcasing UI wireframes, auto-generated accounts, security mechanisms, and gameplay elements.

## MVP Features

The Grid Chain Games prototype concentrates on illustrating the game flow through the implementation of wireframes for key interfaces such as:

### Wallet Connection UI

It simulates account progression within a game cycle and prototypes security mechanisms including:

- Noise layers
- Lifecycle
- Step count
- Step time limit
- Phase validation

Furthermore, it incorporates gameplay mechanisms allowing players to:

- Take steps
- Gain experience
- Collect credits

Additionally, it provides a basic summary of a game cycle.
