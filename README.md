# Grid Chain Games (GCG) â€” An MMO-inspired microgame prototype for Ethereum

## GCG summary:

- An early stage web3 project.
- Built with HTML, CSS & Javascript (mimicking a Solidity-driven game engine).
- Utilizing DOM features to demonstrate concepts, security features & the flow of on-chain data.
- Aims to be the foundation of a gamification model, perhaps a standardized 'support layer' of web3 project representation for the public.
- At its core, GCG is an ETH-driven, browser-based web3 game prototype that focuses on lowering the entry barriers of the Play-to-Earn (P2E) Gaming space (for Ethereum) by encouraging affordable pricing and simplified setup requirements targeting MMOG, casual, and RPG fans.
- GCG's primary focus is to demonstrate vital concepts for a more advanced, structured & controlled security model for Blockchain-driven browser games.
