# Grid Chain Games — An MMO-inspired web3 microgame prototype

Grid Chain Games (from now GCG) is a microgame prototype concept with genAI assets for Ethereum L2.
Focusing on building the foundations of an MMO-inspired blockchain micro-game where users can travel, create assets from materials, & trade.

The project aims to expand the Web3 space for gamers by introducing a low-risk, minimally set-up game that promotes a low screen time approach.

Behind the scenes, GCG is more focused on building a layered security system that strictly defines game phases and time, randomizing and noising user input to fight against automated attacks, and defining fixed game lifecycles to easily synchronize with the emerging evolution of blockchain technology and latest security recommendations.

The current scope of GCG for backdrop build v4 is to build a simplified game cycle & its simulation from the perspective of a single user account while generating data on how other users may interact with the game  — focusing on the travel engine implementation.
